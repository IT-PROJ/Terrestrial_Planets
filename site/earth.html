 <font  color="orchid"> <br> It is third planet from the sun, Earth is the only astronomical object known to host life. It has a solid and active surface with mountains, valleys,
canyons, plains and so much more. Earth's atmosphere has the right thickness to keep the planet warm so living things like us can exist there.
It is the only planet in our solar system we know of that supports life. It is mostly nitrogen, and it has plenty of oxygen for us to breathe.<br></font> </p>
